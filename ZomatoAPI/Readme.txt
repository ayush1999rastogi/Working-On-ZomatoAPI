Our Motivation for using Zomato API
By Collecting the data using Zomato API one can recommend restaurants on the basis of userâ€™s affinity to specific cuisines, establishment types, locations, and price bands.
We can find out whether restaurant support online reservation or not.
We can find what is the most popular and/ or exclusive/new at a given location & time.

In this project using API we found out the answers to some interesting questions and plotted their graphs for visual analysis of the results.
